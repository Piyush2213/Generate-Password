# Password Generator

This is a Java Console Application designed to generate random passwords and assess the strength of user-provided passwords.

## Overview

I developed this project during the Winter Break of my second year, after completing a course on Object-Oriented Effective Java Programming. I wanted to apply my learning to create something practical and interesting. The idea for the project came one evening when I was explaining to my father the importance of strong passwords for his social media accounts. This sparked the idea to build a random password generator. A week later, the project was completed.

While working on it, I also added a feature to evaluate the strength of passwords. Although I was satisfied with the result, I realized the user interface could be more intuitive. So, I decided to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application, which is now available in the Password-Services repository.

## Features

### 1. Password Generation:

- The user is prompted with "Yes" or "No" questions about whether they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols in their password.
- After that, the user specifies the desired password length.
- Based on the user's selections, a pool of characters is created, which includes only the chosen character types.
- Random characters are then picked from this pool to generate a password that meets the user's preferences.
- The generated password is displayed in the console.

### 2. Password Strength Check:

The password strength is assessed according to the following factors:
- The presence of uppercase letters.
- The inclusion of lowercase letters.
- The use of numbers.
- The presence of symbols.
- A minimum length of 8 characters (considered a basic requirement for a secure password).
- An ideal length of 16 characters or more (considered a strong password).

These factors are used to calculate a score that helps determine the password's strength. The score is translated into a message that categorizes the password as "weak," "medium," "good," or "great."

### 3. Password Security Tips:

This feature provides the user with important security advice, including:
- The importance of avoiding password reuse across different accounts.
- Refraining from using easily guessable patterns, such as repeated characters, keyboard sequences, or dictionary words.
- Avoiding using personal information, like names or birthdays, that could be easily associated with the user.
  
These guidelines are displayed in the console to help users create more secure passwords.
